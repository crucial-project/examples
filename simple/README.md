# Base usage

This project contains base applications using Crucial, available under [src/test/java/org/crucial/examples](https://github.com/crucial-project/examples/tree/master/simple/src/test/java/org/crucial/examples). This includes counting words from a web page and a list of urls, as well as approximating the value of Ï€. This last computation is stateful, requiring a DSO server.
